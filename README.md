# System-Analysis

This project was for a customer who wanted to provide resources to individuals preparing for their driving test. The customer, Ian, wanted the system to be accessible online and allow users to take practice tests as well as schedule one-on-one driving lessons.

I was most efficient at identifying flaws in the system throughout the design process. These issues primarily included security vulnerabilities, as well as policy and legal concerns—for example, compliance with PCI DSS.

If I could revise anything, it would be the UML Use Case Diagram. I have already simplified it once, as the initial version was overly complex and too technical. However, the current version still does not align well with the system's requirements.

Gathering system requirements involved meeting with Ian and Liam (the IT officer) and documenting their specific needs based on their respective roles. Capturing detailed requirements is crucial, as missing key details can significantly delay the design and deployment timeline.

Designing a system begins with gathering requirements, identifying functional and non-functional requirements, and then creating diagrams that can be further developed into technical components throughout the system’s lifecycle. In the future, I would implement more precise and detailed sequence diagrams. I find these diagrams particularly useful as they clearly illustrate how different components interact within the system.
